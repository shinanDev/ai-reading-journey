„A curated list of books, resources and reflections on my journey into Ethical AI, LLMs and Machine Learning in German and English language.“

As part of my retraining as a **Software Developer (Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung)** and my work in **Ethical AI Communication**, I'm building a personal learning path with strong foundations in **LLMs, Machine Learning**, and **Responsible AI**.

This repository documents my journey through curated books, resources, and notes.
